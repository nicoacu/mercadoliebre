This is part of a mandatory project thats teached on the [Digital House] course that I'm attending to. 

Using primarily HTML, CSS, Node.js and Express.js, the purpose is to replicate a a website similar to the one from [Mercado Libre], making sure that the website has a responsive UI.

Note that the purpose is to work with all the languages and frameworks that we're using, so the final result might have unfinished features (e.g: hyperlinks that doesn't redirect anywhere).</p>
